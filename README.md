# Bookstore
A GUI project that resembles what the University of Washington online shop would look like. It should allow the user to order an item and the program should calculate its cost and the total cost of everything. The program is also able to take in discounts if the user has a store membership.

At first, the user will have to insert their username and password or create a whole new username and password.
